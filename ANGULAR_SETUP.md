   - Copy to clipboard functionality
   - Material Design expansion panels

3. **Main AppComponent** (`/app.component.ts`)
   - WebSocket connection management
   - State management for all models
   - Real-time progress tracking
   - Summary generation and display
   - Error handling with snackbar notifications
   - Export functionality (copy/download reports)

### ‚úÖ Services & Infrastructure

1. **WebSocketService** (`/services/websocket.service.ts`)
   - Real-time communication with FastAPI backend
   - Session management to prevent cross-contamination
   - Connection status monitoring
   - Message filtering and routing

2. **ApiService** (`/services/api.service.ts`)
   - REST API integration for model management
   - Meta-summary generation
   - Model refresh functionality

3. **TypeScript Interfaces** (`/models/model.interfaces.ts`)
   - Complete type safety for all data structures
   - Model definitions for components and services

### ‚úÖ Modern UI Features

- **Material Design 3** theming
- **Gradient backgrounds** and modern styling
- **Real-time animations** and status indicators
- **Mobile-responsive** layout
- **Dark theme** compatible
- **Accessibility** features built-in

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed
node --version
npm --version
```

### Installation & Running
```bash
# Navigate to Angular frontend
cd angular-frontend

# Install dependencies (already done)
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
# or
npm run serve

# The app will be available at http://localhost:4200
```

### Building for Production
```bash
# Development build
npm run build:dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Files will be in dist/ directory
```

## üîó Integration with Backend

The Angular frontend seamlessly integrates with the existing FastAPI backend:

- **REST API**: `http://localhost:8000/api`
- **WebSocket**: `ws://localhost:8000/ws`
- **Proxy configuration** included for development

## üì± Features Overview

### üéõÔ∏è Processing Controls
- **Multi-mode processing**: Batch (3 at a time), Parallel (all models), Sequential (one by one)
- **Response length control**: From brief sentences to detailed paragraphs
- **Custom length**: Specify exact number of lines (1-50)
- **Stop functionality**: Halt processing at any time
- **Model refresh**: Reload available Ollama models

### üìä Real-time Model Cards
- **Live streaming**: See responses as they're generated
- **Status indicators**: Visual feedback for each model's state
- **Expandable content**: Preview or full response view
- **Performance metrics**: Word count and completion tracking
- **Copy functionality**: Individual response copying

### üß† AI-Powered Summary
- **Intelligent analysis**: Best model analyzes all responses
- **Performance statistics**: Completion rates and metrics
- **Recommendations**: Insights about model performance
- **Export options**: Copy summary or download detailed report

### üì± Responsive Design
- **Mobile-first**: Optimized for all screen sizes
- **Touch-friendly**: Proper touch targets and gestures
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Ctrl+Enter to submit questions quickly

## üé® UI/UX Improvements Over Original

### Visual Enhancements
- **Material Design consistency** throughout
- **Professional gradients** and modern color scheme
- **Smooth animations** and transitions
- **Status-based color coding** for immediate visual feedback

### User Experience
- **Better state management**: No confusing "Pending" states when idle
- **Clearer progress indication**: Real-time progress bars and status messages
- **Improved error handling**: User-friendly error messages with snackbars
- **Export functionality**: Save and share comparison results

### Performance
- **Optimized rendering**: Virtual scrolling for large model lists
- **Efficient state updates**: Minimal re-renders with OnPush change detection
- **Memory management**: Proper cleanup of subscriptions and resources

## üîß Development Notes

### Architecture
- **Standalone components**: Modern Angular approach
- **Reactive programming**: RxJS observables for all async operations
- **Type safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- **Modular design**: Reusable components and services

### Best Practices
- **OnDestroy cleanup**: Proper subscription management
- **Error boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling
- **Loading states**: User feedback during operations
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## üö¶ Next Steps

The Angular frontend is fully functional and ready to use. To get started:

1. **Start the backend** (FastAPI server on port 8000)
2. **Run the Angular frontend** (port 4200)
3. **Open http://localhost:4200** in your browser
4. **Ask questions** and compare AI model responses!

The implementation provides a significant upgrade over the vanilla HTML/CSS/JS version with:
- Better maintainability through TypeScript and Angular structure
- Enhanced user experience with Material Design
- Improved performance with optimized rendering
- Professional-grade error handling and state management

Enjoy comparing AI models with your new Angular-powered interface! üéØ
